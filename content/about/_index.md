### Okay, so, who is she?

<img src="/stickers/marmalade-curious.png" alt="Marmalade looking curious" width="250" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;">

She's just your generic orange catgirl. That's it.

What she *represents* matters way more than what she looks like.

> **Think of her as a blank canvas.**

She wasn't *designed* so much as she just sort of... showed up. She doesn't belong to anyone, and that's the whole point!

That's basically what **marmalade.you** means: she is yours.

### The Origin Story

Marmalade actually started life as "Gothfield", a character LoRA I found on CivitAI. I wasn't trying to create a character or anything. I was just messing around with LoRAs, trying them, combining them with other stuff, seeing what happens. 

She never really felt like she was mine. Seeing her in different styles, different outfits, it made her feel bigger than "this one specific design".

And that's kind of the point. She was always meant to be remixed and adapted. Later I wanted to make something I could release as CC0 without worrying about rights or ownership, as "Gothfield" was way too close to another orange cat. Once I renamed her to "Marmalade", she started feeling like her own thing. 

I started drawing her myself, making stickers, variations, that kind of stuff, and slowly she got a bit of a personality. 

> ***But make no mistake: Marmalade isn't *my* character. She's for anyone who wants to use her.***

### Why CC0?

<img src="/stickers/marmalade-annoyed.png" alt="Eye roll" width="180" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; transform: rotate(-5deg);">

I come from a coding background, where open source is normal. You learn from other people's work, you fork things, you build on top, and everyone benefits because sharing is the default.

I got tired of seeing the opposite in some art spaces. Not just the "do not repost, my OC, do not steal" stuff - but watching people get shut out for *how* they create. I think art should be something we build *on* together, not lock away.

I think the question worth asking is: **"What happens if we stop being precious about it?"**

So, here she is, **CC0**. I'm sharing <a class="about-cta-link" href="/lab">*everything*</a> I can - CSP files, timelapses, code, project files - because it's way more fun when you can peek under the hood. I want you to be able to pick things apart and build on top of them, same way I do.

### She is CC0 (Public Domain)

Simply put: Marmalade is **free** for you to use, remix, and share in any way you like. You don't need to ask for permission, give credit (though it's always appreciated!), or worry about copyright.

Use whatever tools you want. Code, paint, write, sculpt, remix, AI - all good. If you made something, it counts.

<p class="muted">You'll see that green eye pop up around the site, or on Marmalade herself. The vertical pupil is a little "0" and represents the CC0 symbol (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/"><img src="/logos/Cc-zero_white.svg" alt="CC0" class="cc0-inline" /></a>). If it's there, the file's public domain and you're free to use it.</p>

So:
*   want to put her in your indie game? **Do it.**
*   want to stream as her? **Go for it.**
*   want to print stickers and sell them? **Yes.** (and give me a link, I want some too)
*   want to redesign her completely? **Please do.**

This site is just a hub. One half is **The Source** (where I drop my files), and the other half is **In The Wild** (where you can show off what you've made with her).

### Share your Creations!
Made something with Marmalade? I'd genuinely love to see it! Whether it's a game, a song, a drawing, a cosplay, or something I haven't even thought of, I'd love to feature it on the <a class="about-cta-link" href="/community">In The Wild</a> page.

### Just Have Fun

Don't overthink it.

Just make stuff. Share it if you want. Be kind to others.

Now go have fun with her!
