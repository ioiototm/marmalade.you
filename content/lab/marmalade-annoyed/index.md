## What is this?

An annoyed Marmalade sticker, because why not. 

## The Story

This sticker was originally drawn for [chuk_chan](https://www.twitch.tv/chuk_chan)'s stream custom stickers. First animated sticker as well. And yes, I did use DaVinci Resolve to make the GIF... Created the animation in Clip Studio Paint, but then I exported the frames, imported them into Resolve as I am a bit more familiar with it, and then exported the GIF from there. 

## What's included?

The static PNG sticker, and a GIF version where she rolls her eyes. The GIF is in v1.0 - I haven't updated it yet to include the new black tips on her ears.
