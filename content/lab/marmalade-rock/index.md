This is a glam rock inspired design of Marmalade, with fishnets, a skirt, and a leather jacket. She was created as the design on the loyalty card for the system that [chuk_chan](https://www.twitch.tv/chuk_chan) uses for his stream. Thus, the .clip file is the complete card design with her, you can separate her out. The two other images are just her on a transparent background.
