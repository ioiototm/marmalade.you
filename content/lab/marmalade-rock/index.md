## What is this?

A glam rock inspired design of Marmalade, with fishnets, a skirt, and a leather jacket (and even glasses!). Notably, the first instance of the CC0 eye design, hanging off her belt.

## The Story

She was created as the design on the loyalty card for the system that [chuk_chan](https://www.twitch.tv/chuk_chan) uses for his stream. People can chose their loyalty cards, and this is one of them.

## What's included?

The .clip file is the complete card design with her on it, you can separate her out if you need it. The two other images are just her on a transparent background with and without glow.
