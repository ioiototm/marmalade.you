## What is this?

This is my masterpiece, my magnum opus, the pinnacle of my artistic career... a design of Marmalade as a bunny girl for a cup. 

## The Story

Actually inspired by another cup design of [Loodie](https://dearart.blog/loodie-and-orange-cat/) (the [Chuk Chan](https://www.twitch.tv/chuk_chan) dog girl character version of Odie, the Garfield dog) as a bunny girl, done by [MimiOS.exe](https://www.instagram.com/MimiOS.exe/) for his stream. I really liked that design and wanted to do something similar with Marmalade. And yes, v0.5 does say Gothfield, back then Marmalade wasn't a thing, but I gave her the name shortly after, thus the name change to Marmalade's Depresso Espresso.

This design was made for a cup, but I haven't actually printed it on a cup yet. Maybe one day! If anyone wants to print it on a cup for themselves, go for it - I saw it is quite cheap actually.
