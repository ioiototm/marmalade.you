## What is this?
The original design of Marmalade, with a goth aesthetic. Well, she was Gothfield back then, but this was the first one.

## The Story
Submitted it to the [Loading Artist](https://loadingartist.com/) Art Critique channel, with the words:
>I did this over the winter break every night while being bored at home, on my phone (even though i brought my tablet), as i was too lazy to get up on the chair from my bed.

Which made [this](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxMo-wqb_G0AsgJulUIUg3-8aDQu0MnFc1) hilarious reaction from him.

## What's included?
The .clip file made from the exports from Penup, with nicely named layers (took so long), and two PNGs, with and without background (and apparently, one has a black bow and the other has a red one, too lazy to fix that).
