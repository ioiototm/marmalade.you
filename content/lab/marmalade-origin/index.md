This is one of the first "original" drawings of Marmalade that I did, back in early 2025.

I used Penup on my phone to draw her, if you open the project file, you will see some sketchy layers - as Penup doesn't support any other export than image, I had to export each layer manually, and then add it in Clip Studio Paint to make the .clip file. 

This also spawned the first fanart of her, after I put it for Art Critique by [Loading Artist](https://loadingartist.com/) on his Discord and Stream. 

It was done by Stroyke, which you can find in the [community](/community) section - a clean retraced lineart of this drawing. It was the first time I saw someone draw her based on my work, and it was really exciting!

Funnily enough, he actually followed LoadingArtist's advice of changing the bow colour to red to make it pop, which I have been too lazy to do in my own drawing. One day I will upload an updated version.
