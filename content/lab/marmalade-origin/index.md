## What is this?

One of the first "original" drawings of Marmalade, done back in early 2025 on my phone using Penup.

## The Story

I drew her on Penup on my phone - if you open the project file, you will see some sketchy layers. Penup doesn't support any export other than image, so I had to export each layer manually and then add them in Clip Studio Paint to make the .clip file.

This also spawned the very first fanart of Marmalade. I put it up for Art Critique by [Loading Artist](https://loadingartist.com/) on his Discord and stream (and got some nice feedback), and Stroyke retraced her. You can find his version in the [community](/community) section. It was the first time I saw someone draw her based on my work, made me really happy!

Funnily enough, he actually followed Loading Artist's advice of changing the bow colour to red to make it pop, which I have been too lazy to do in my own drawing. One day I will upload an updated version.

## What's included?

The exported PNG and the .clip source file with all the (somewhat messy) layers from the Penup-to-CSP conversion.
