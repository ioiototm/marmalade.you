Here I am sharing the CSP source files, PNGs, and project files for PNGTube-Remix, which is the software I use for Marmalade's current model. You can use these as a starting point for your own PNG Tube models, or just to see how I set things up.

As with everything, it's a work in progress, and I will be constantly updating these things. To try the model out, you can download PNGTube-Remix from [itch.io](https://mudkipworld.itch.io/pngremix) and just open the .pngRemix file.
