## What is this?

A collection of the PNG Tuber files I use for streaming, including the CSP source files, PNGs, and project files for PNGTube-Remix, which is the software I use for Marmalade's current model. You can use these as a starting point for your own PNG Tube models, or just to see how I set things up.

## The Story

I needed a PNG model for streaming, as I wanted to have a nice model of Marmalade on stream, so, decided to make the first model using PNGTube-Remix, rather than stuff like Live2D, which I don't have the time or energy to learn right now (it is in the plans though!). I drew the model in Clip Studio Paint, and then set it up in PNGTube-Remix. 

## What's included?

Right now, I am including the .clip file with her model (and the 4 references I used), the .pngRemix file, and the exported PNG. 

## How to use?
As with everything, it's a work in progress, and I will be constantly updating these things. To try the model out, you can download PNGTube-Remix from [itch.io](https://mudkipworld.itch.io/pngremix) and just open the .pngRemix file.
